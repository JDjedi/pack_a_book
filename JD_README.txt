Goals
-----
Coding challenge involving parsing amazon webpages(within a file in the repo) for book information and extracts it.

The program then sorts the books into boxes by weight specification; total weight cannot exceed 10lbs.

The box contents and information is then outputted in a JSON format.

What I learned
--------------
This is the direction I want to take my progamming career in, full fledged software development

Taking the vast amounts of information and data and using programming to turn that into something meaningful is both challenging and fun

How to make classes and objects interact seamlessly

Development process and planning coupled with execcution

Ruby install guide:

	+ If using OSX or linux: 
		While in the command prompt type "ruby-install" and let it work its magic

Ruby gems install guide:
	
	+ Since we will be using ruby 2.3 we do not need to install ruby gems in a specific manner,
		irregardless of what ever platform you are using.

Ruby gems that are required and how to install them:
	
	+ In order run the program correctly a few gems must be installed. In order to install the gems
		one need only type "gem install GEM_NAME" within the command prompt. Thats it!

		For example: "gem install nokogiri"

	+ The ruby gems required for this program are as follows:
		- rubygems
		- nokogiri
		- open-uri
		- json
		- neatjson

At this point you are ready to run my program, in order to do so do the following:

	+ In the command prompt change to the root directory, the directory that contains pack_a_book.rb
	+ Type in "ruby pack_a_book.rb" and press enter
	+ Follow th instructions given once the program is running
	+ Once the program is complete the final product should be placed within the root 
		directory's output folder

If there are any issues, questions, concerns or hiccups please contact me, Jonathan Diaz, at jcdiaz1201@gmail.com
Take care and I hope you enjoy using pack-a-book!
